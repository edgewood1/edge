title:  Passing to Child 1

To recap:

The parent renders the child component 4 times.
Each time, it assigns from its state the following values: 
 unique id, counter setting, and value. 

The child handles design and functino of each button.   

--------

 
In the parent, we rendered the child, assigning state variables.

In the child, data/varaibles that we pass down are saved in the 'this.props' variable.

So in the child, we set up the state to take the 'values' variable: 

```javascript
class Child extends Component {
  state = {
    count: this.props.value
  };
  ```

If, in the child, you console.log this.props... 

```javascript
  console.log('props', this.props);
```

You see 4 objects represented, one for each object in our parent's state.counters array: 

```javascript
props {value: 4, selected: true}
props {value: 3, selected: true}
props {value: 2, selected: true}
props {value: 0, selected: true}
```

In the above, props will not show key because that is just the id

Props is actually an object from React.Component that lists all the attributes in the current component.
