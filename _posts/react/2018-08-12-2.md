props are inputs to a React component passed down from a parent component to a child component.

Remember that props are readonly. They should not be modified in any way:

If a value must be modified, use state instead.

props.children
props.children is available on every component. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example:

If in the parent comp:

```javascript
<Welcome>Hello world!</Welcome>

```
The string Hello world! is available in props.children in the Welcome (child) component:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
return <p>{props.children}</p>;
}

```
For components defined as classes, use this.props.children:

my example

in parent, we have our initial rendering with a self-closing component tag:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

if in parent, we create opening/closing component tags, and place regular tags within these:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value}>
        <h4> Wow </h4>
      </Child>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

If we enclose the <h4> tag in the Child tags as above, a console.log(this.props) in the child's render method will reveal a 'props.children' property:

```javascript
props {value: 4, children: {…}}
props {value: 3, children: {…}}
props {value: 2, children: {…}}
props {value: 0, children: {…}}
```

Opening this 'children' property reveals the type and props:

```javascript
children:
{$$typeof: Symbol(react.element), type: "h4",
    key: null, ref: null, props: {children: "wow"}, …}
value:4
key:(...)
get key:ƒ ()
```

Now, in the Child component, we can render the this.props.children, which, among other elements, is carrying the <h4> wow </h4> tag, and will
render this as a kind of title above each counter/button line:

```javascript
render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {this.props.children}
        ...counter/button lines...
    )}
```

recap:

1. in the parent's render method, we add an <h4>wow</h4> within open/close <Child> tags
2. the child has access to this new element via the this.props.children and uses it in button
3. the title and button are sent to the parent for final rendering.

instead of the parent's <h4> wow </h4>, we could also have dynamic title:

```javascript
<h4> Counter: {counter.id} </h4>
```

Or in the parent, we could pass counter.id as an attribute:

```javascript
<div>
  {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
    <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} id={counter.id} />
  ))}
</div>
```

And include the <h4> tags in the child rendering:

```javascript
    return(
     <React.Fragment>
      <h4>Counter: {this.props.id}</h4>
        <span className={this.getBadgeClasses()}>
```

this is passing parent to child?

the first is passing parent to child

react has one-way data flow.
3 ways it flows
children> parent - use callback and states
parent> child - use prop
-- I can pass it as a prop to the child when I instantiate it within the parent.
-- class Parent { render() { listname = "mel" }return (<Child listnamefrom parent={listname}/>)}
sibling>sibling - combo
