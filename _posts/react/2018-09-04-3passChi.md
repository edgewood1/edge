title: Passing to Child 3

Since in the parent, we pass counter.id as an attribute:

```javascript
<div>
  {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
    <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} id={counter.id} />
  ))}
</div>
```

This way, instead of a hard-coded <h4> wow </h4>, we could have a dynamic title passed via props:
And include the <h4> tags in the child rendering:

```javascript
    return(
     <React.Fragment>
      <h4>Counter: {this.props.id}</h4>
        <span className={this.getBadgeClasses()}>
```
