title: Nested Components

Below, we have "stateless" component classes that hold references to other components; that is, they nest other components: 

1.  First, import React: 

```javascript
import React from 'react';
```
    
    {:start="2"}
2.  In this case, the main component (App) will hold references to two other components (Nav and Body).  Because it contains other components, it is called a "parent":  

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Nav />
                <Body />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

    {:start="3"}
3.  Then we define Nav & Body: 


```javascript
class Nav extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Nav</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

class Body extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Body</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```
    {:start="4"}
4.  And of course, in the end, we export the parent app: 

```javascript
export default App;
```
