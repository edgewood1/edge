We typically begin by importing whatever React export from the React module. 

We then use the Component class / object to create a "component class".

That is, our new class will inherit the various properties from Component, and then we will add to this.  The keyword *extend* allows us to inherit these properties: 

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class Contacts extends React.Component 
    { ... our class body ... };
```

For cases of more than one JSX expression, we need a parent element *<div>*

```javascript
return (
    <div>
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <button>Increment</button>
    </div>
);
```

or, if we don't want the extra div to show in the console.log, we can replace the *<div>* with: 

```javascript
return (
    <React.Fragment>
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <button>Increment</button>
    </React.Fragment>
);

```
