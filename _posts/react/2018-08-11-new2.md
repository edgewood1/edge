In your comonents folder, you could have a master/parent component and a child component. 

In the child component, you create an increment button and handle the count.  

In your parent component, you could render 4 such child buttons. 

Each of these counters would maintain their own state, so if you click on one counter, it would track its own increments whereas another counter would track its own apart from the first - even though both have their source in the same code.

In terms of our previous code: 
1. Change index.js to render a parent instead of a child (import parent)
2. Create a parent and import the child

Below we see a few things: 
1. the child being imported from "./counter"
2. this child counter being rendered 4 times:  

```javascript
import React, {Component} from "react";
import Counter from "./counter";

class Counters extends Component {
    state = {
        counters: 0
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
To revise the previous code, we could add id and value properties for each of the created counters...


```javascript
  state = {
    counters: [
      {id: 1, value: 0}, 
      {id: 2, value: 0}, 
      {id: 3, value: 0}, 
      {id: 4, value: 0}, 
    ]
  }
```

 ... and use the map method to render each comp with its own object property.  The 'key' attribute is a reference to a unique id:  

```javascript
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
   {this.state.counters.map(counter => 
      <Counter key={counter.id} 
        value={counter.value}
        selected={true}/>)}
      </div>
    )
  }
```
