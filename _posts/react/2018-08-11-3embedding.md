title:  Embedding Components
---

In the child component, we might create an increment button that handles the count, 
each maintaining their own state, each tracking its own increment.  

The parent component can contain any number of child components, which are imported.
In the parent component, we could render 4 such child buttons. 

index.js renders the parent component.

```javascript
import React, {Component} from "react";
import Counter from "./counter";

class Counters extends Component {
  state = {
    counters: [
      {id: 1, value: 0}, 
      {id: 2, value: 0}, 
      {id: 3, value: 0}, 
      {id: 4, value: 0}, 
    ]
  }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
                <Counter />
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
 
Instead of embedding 4 Child methods, we can: 
- use the map method to render each child with state.  
- pass state to this Child: in particular key (unique id) & value variables. 
 

```javascript
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.counters.map(counter => 
            <Counter key={counter.id} 
              value={counter.value}/>)}
      </div>
    )
  }
```
