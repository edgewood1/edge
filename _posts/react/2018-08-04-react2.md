You can write a component that holds references to other components.  In the example below, we have a "stateless" component. 

1.  First, import React: 

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    ```
    {:start="2"}
2.  In this case, the main component (App) will hold references to two other components (Nav and Body):  

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Nav/>
                <Body/>
            </div>
        );
    }
    }
    ```
    {:start="3"}
3.  Then we add these two references: 

    ```javascript
    class Nav extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Nav</h1>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }

    class Body extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Body</h1>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
    ```
    {:start="4"}
4.  And of course, in the end, we export: 

    ```javascript
    export default App;
    ```
