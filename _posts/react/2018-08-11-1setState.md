title:  Updating State

To recap, a React component consists of 4 parts: 

1. import your modules
2. create a class (a kind of constructor/object) that consists of
3. your objects and methods
4. exporting your class

Updating State

We can't modify the state directly

This doesn't work (React wouldn't be aware of it, and so it wouldn't update the view:)

```javascript
handleIncrement = () => {
    this.state.count++;
}
```

So use a Component method setState(), which will explicitly tell React what has changed. The argument will either be added to state or overwrite them:

```javascript
handleIncrement = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1});
}
```

What happens when state changes? 

1. when we call this.setState, we are telling React that the state of a component will change.  
2. React will then schedule a call to the render().  Because this is an asynch call, this call could happen at anytime in the near future - it's hard to say when.  
3. render() will return a new react element, which is our <div>, which has two children, <span> and <button>.  

*The virtual DOM*

Our virtual DOM is a tree with three elements <div> <span>/<button>

But then we suggest a new tree with our render() call.  
React compares the two trees in the virtual DOM to see what has been modified.  
It may realize that only <span> is different, so it will then only adjust <span> in the real browser DOM.  Nothing else will be updated.
