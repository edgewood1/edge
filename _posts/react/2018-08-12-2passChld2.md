What are props? 

- inputs to a React component 
- they pass these inputs from parent to child. 
- they are READ ONLY.  
- if you want to WRITE, use state instead.  

"props.children" is another property of "props". 
- it is available on every component. 
- it contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example:

If in the parent comp:

```javascript
<Welcome><h4>Hello world!</h4></Welcome>

```

then in the child comp, we can:

- console.log(this.props.children) and get "Hello world!"
- console.log(this.props.type) and get "h4".
 

If our parent has a self-closing tag, children will be undefined: 

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

if in parent, we create opening/closing component tags, and place regular tags within these:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value}>
        <h4> Wow </h4>
      </Child>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

If we enclose the <h4> tag in the Child tags as above, a console.log(this.props) in the child's render method will reveal a 'props.children' property:

```javascript
props {value: 4, children: {…}}
props {value: 3, children: {…}}
props {value: 2, children: {…}}
props {value: 0, children: {…}}
```

Opening this 'children' property reveals the type and props:

```javascript
children:
  {$$typeof: Symbol(react.element), 
    type: "h4",
    key: null, 
    ref: null, 
    props: {children: "wow"}, …}
    value:4
    key:(...)
    get key:ƒ ()
```

In the child comp, we can render this.props.children as a kind of title, 
since it will print <h4> wow </h4> tag for each counter/button line:

```javascript
render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {this.props.children}
        ...counter/button lines...
    )}
```

recap:

1. in the parent's render method, we add an <h4>wow</h4> within open/close <Child> tags
2. the child has access to this new element via the this.props.children
